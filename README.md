Day 1 notes:
Still planning my idea out. I kinda forgot it was today so I don't really have a great idea in mind to finish in like a day, plus I'm not really familiar with any game engine worth using right now. But that's okay. If push comes to shove I WILL release a totally very original RPG or shooter game with the default Unreal template T_T.
