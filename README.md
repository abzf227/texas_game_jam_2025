Day 1 notes:

*Still planning my idea out. I kinda forgot it was today so I don't really have a great idea in mind to finish in like a day, plus I'm not really familiar with any game engine worth using right now. But that's okay. If push comes to shove I WILL release a totally very original RPG or shooter game with the default Unreal template T_T.

*I've decided on Unity! Going to need to speed-learn this engine though. Hopefully my previous knowledge of programming helps out.

*I think I'm going to scrap my first idea. It was a cool idea, but I think I have way too little experience and there's too many working parts for me to finish in time. I have a second idea in mind, but I don't think it's as cool. I don't know. I think I should sleep on it because it's nearing 2 AM and still not much is complete.
